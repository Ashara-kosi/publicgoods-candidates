On the other hand, natural ecosystems are able to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it. Forests alone hold 250 billion tons of carbon (about 7 times the global emissions per year). To achieve net zero emissions, we must reduce all emissions and enhance sinks in the Land Sector. ",
